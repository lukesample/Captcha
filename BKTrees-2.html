            Let’s say we have a 
            <img src="https://lukesample.000webhostapp.com/captcha/dictionary%20of%20words.jpeg">
            and then we have some other words which are to be checked in the 
            <img src="https://lukesample.000webhostapp.com/captcha/dictionary%20for%20spelling%20errors.jpeg">
            . We need to have collection of all 
            <img src="https://lukesample.000webhostapp.com/captcha/words%20in%20the%20dictionary.jpeg">
            which are very close to the given word. For instance if we are checking a word “ruk” we will have {“truck”,”buck”,”duck”,……}. Therefore, spelling mistake can be corrected by deleting a character from the word or adding a new character in the word or by replacing the character in the word by some appropriate one. Therefore, we will be using the edit distance as a measure for correctness and matching of the misspelled word from the words in our dictionary.

             As we know that each node in 
             <img src="https://lukesample.000webhostapp.com/captcha/BK%20Tree.jpeg">
             is constructed on basis of 
             <img src="https://lukesample.000webhostapp.com/captcha/edit-distance%20measure.jpeg">
             from its parent. Therefore, we will directly be going from root node to specific nodes that lie within the tolerance limit. Lets, say our tolerance limit is TOL and the edit-distance of the current node from the misspelled word is dist. Therefore, now instead of iterating over all its children we will only iterate over its children that have edit distance in range
